## Write a batch set
### Create batch set file
1. Create a new .txt file.
2. Open it.
3. Add **"activate"** on the first line.
4. Save the file.

**NOTE**\
*After you write activate on the first line, the file is now considered a valid batch set.*

### Add item for batch set

4. Try to remember it, or just write it on a note.
5. Decide your name pick for the indication, for example.\
   ```AK-47```

   ```[AK-47] (bf4_ak47)```
